# LDAP-Config-Manager
This small python based project is used to integrate new Computers in a LDAP managed Network environment. It features a clear and minimalistic GUI.


How to use it:
-Check if tkinter is installed on your device
-Add in the script your desired IPs and the associated VLANs into the first method
-Add IPs in the dropdown menu
-Execute the script via python3 command


Bugs:
-Vlan name doesn't reload after changes in the IP dropbox menu.

To-Do:
-Standalone .exe binarie for Windows
-Icon

Tested:
-Fedora 32, VSC with python3 and tkinter installed
-Every bigger Linux distribution with python and tkinter (likely in your repo) installed should work
